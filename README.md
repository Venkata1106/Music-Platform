# Music Streaming Service - Data Model and Analytics

This project outlines the design and implementation of a robust and scalable data model for a music streaming service. The data model supports core functionalities such as user management, playlist creation, song and artist tracking, payment processing, and analytics. The project also includes SQL and NoSQL queries for data analysis, along with Python scripts for connecting to MySQL and generating visualizations.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**
The primary goal is to design a data model that supports the core functionalities of a music streaming service, including:
- User profile management
- Playlist creation and management
- Song and artist tracking
- Payment processing and subscription plans
- Promotional offers and discounts
- Analytics for business insights

### **Key Features**
- **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**: Defines entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **UML Class Diagram**: Maps the conceptual model to a relational model.
- **SQL and NoSQL Queries**: Provides analytical insights into user behavior, revenue trends, artist popularity, and more.
- **Python Integration**: Connects to MySQL, executes queries, and generates visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## **Data Model**

### **Entities and Relationships**
The data model includes the following entities:
- **Users**: Manages user profiles (e.g., `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `country`).
- **Playlists**: Allows users to create and manage playlists (e.g., `playlist_id`, `user_id`, `playlist_name`).
- **Songs**: Tracks song details (e.g., `song_id`, `title`, `genre`, `artist_id`, `likes`, `play_count`).
- **Artists**: Manages artist information (e.g., `artist_id`, `name`, `followers`).
- **Payment Options**: Stores user payment details (e.g., `user_id`, `card_type`, `company_name`, `card_number`).
- **Devices**: Tracks user devices (e.g., `device_id`, `device_name`, `device_type`, `user_id`).
- **Transactions**: Records subscription purchases (e.g., `transaction_id`, `user_id`, `plan_id`, `amount`, `date`).
- **Plans**: Manages subscription plans (e.g., `plan_id`, `plan_name`, `duration`, `premium_level`, `price`).
- **Offers**: Tracks promotional offers (e.g., `offer_id`, `card_type`, `company_name`, `discount_percentage`).

### **Challenges and Considerations**
- Efficiently handling many-to-many relationships (e.g., playlists and songs).
- Ensuring data security for user information and payment details.
- Scalability to accommodate growing data (e.g., more users, songs, and transactions).

## **SQL Queries**

The project includes SQL queries for analytical purposes, such as:
1. **Top Devices Used by Users**: Identifies the most popular device types.
2. **Monthly Revenue from Subscriptions**: Provides a monthly breakdown of revenue.
3. **Subscription Plan Popularity**: Analyzes the popularity of different subscription plans.
4. **Ranking Artists by Popularity**: Ranks artists based on follower count.
5. **Number of Songs by Artist**: Identifies the most prolific artists.
6. **User Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Estimates the total revenue generated by each user.
7. **User Satisfaction Ratio for Songs**: Measures user engagement and satisfaction.
8. **Diversity of User Playlists**: Determines playlists with the most variety in genres.
9. **Average Song Likes by Genre**: Calculates average likes per genre.
10. **User Ranking by Total Spend**: Identifies the highest-spending users.

## **NoSQL Queries**

The project also includes NoSQL queries for MongoDB, such as:
1. **Active Users by Country**: Counts active users by country.
2. **Most Used Payment Options**: Identifies the most commonly used payment methods.
3. **Top Spending Users**: Analyzes transactions to identify top spenders.
4. **Track User Device Changes**: Monitors how frequently users change devices.

## **Python Integration**

### **Connecting Python with MySQL**
The project includes Python scripts to:
- Connect to a MySQL database using `mysql-connector-python`.
- Execute SQL queries and fetch results.
- Generate visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### **Visualizations**
- **Bar Charts**: For device usage and subscription plan popularity.
- **Line Charts**: For monthly revenue trends.
- **Pie Charts**: For subscription plan distribution.
- **Lollipop Charts**: For artist popularity rankings.
